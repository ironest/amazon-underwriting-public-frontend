## Intro

The project revolves around the **Amazon Underwriting Pty Ltd** business; they are a privately owned underwriting agency focussed on delivering insurance packages tailored for specific niche markets.

### Purpose

Create a website to be used as a landing page in order to advertise **Amazon Underwriting PTY Ltd** on the internet with a more modern UI/UX.

### Functionality

* Database provisioning
* Collection of user contact details
* Authentication for Admin User
* Administrator panel
  * Upload of new documents
  * Deletion of old documents
  * Hide/Show of WIP documents

### Getting Started

Each project requires a quick configuration before being usable; configuration relies on few environment variables variables which can be prepared through a `.env` file in the root of each project.

The **backend project** requires:
```
DB_HOST=mongodb://localhost/<yourDBName>
PORT=
JWT_SECRET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
```

The **public Frontend project** requires:
```
REACT_APP_BASEURL=<yourExpressAppURL>
PORT=
```

The **admin Frontend project** requires:
```
REACT_APP_BASEURL=<yourExpressAppURL>
PORT=
```

**Once finished with the configuration steps**, it is possible to start each individual project:

**1. To spin up the backend server:**
   * open a terminal and move to folder `./src/backend`
   * install any dependencies by running `npm install`
   * Seed the database (including admin credential) with the command `npm run seed`
   * start the server with `npm run dev-server`

**2. To start the public frontend**
   * open a new terminal and move to `./src/public-frontend`
   * install any dependencies by running `npm install`
   * start the app with `npm start`

**3. To start the admin frontend (acting as CMS)**
   * open a new terminal and move into `./src/admin-frontend`
   * install any dependencies by running `npm install`
   * start the app with `npm start`

**4. To visit the public frontend app`**
   * open a browser window and visit `http://localhost:3002/`

**5. To visit the admin frontend app**
   * open a browser window and visit `http://localhost:3001`

The credential currently held in the database are:
```
  email: user@domain.com
  password: password
```
